assignment 2 log
----------------------------------------

first I used the did export LC_ALL='C'
then I used the command locale and it did as intended

commnands:
/usr/share/dict/words
cp words /u/eng/class/classave/cs35l/assignment2
sort words

//in my assignment2/cs35L 
commands:
wget -o assign2.txt web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

now that I got all my files into my working directory I now tested the tr
commands

commands:
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt

this command seems to remove all non-alpha strings and leaves a string on each
line with many spaces between each word non-uniformly
