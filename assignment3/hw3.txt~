Q1)
It was not neccessary to remove the 
case_long_iso_time_style since there was another
case: case long_iso_time_style  above in the patch so
it would have fallen through in the switch statement

Q2)
the patch changes the data time formats
to year month day hour minutes, it might introduce problems
when users dont understand english


Q3)

[classave@lnxsrv07 ~]$ python randline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

in the randline.py code:
 try:
        numlines = int(options.numlines)
    except:
	parser.error("invalid NUMLINES: {0}".

because it was empty and the number of lines is zero it throws out 
an index error because there is no lines in an empty file


Q4)
[classave@lnxsrv07 ~]$ /usr/local/cs/bin/python3 randline.py /dev/null
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):

I looked at the code and the lines reads this:

    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
        parser.error("I/O error({0}): {1}".
	             format(errno, strerror))

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

the correct syntax should be 

except IOerror as err
                      
exceptions in python2 is iteratable which was taken out in python3
