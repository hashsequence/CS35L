python list
dictionaries
commands:

python

>>>list=[] //dont need to specifies type or size
>>>list = [23, "L"]
>>print list
[23,'L']
//list from python starts from index zero
>> print list[0]
23
>>>print list[1]
L
// I can use + to concatenate the list
>>>list1 = [1,2,3,4]
>>>list2 = [4,5,6]
>>>merged=list1+list2
>>>print merged
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

//we have another data stucture call a dictionary
//a dictionary is basically a collection
//{key:value}
//in dictionaries it is like a hashtable
//keys must be unique and immutable
//keys can take any data type, int chars strings
//declare a ditionary by using curly bracces
>>>dict={}
>>> dict[1]='A'
>>>dict[2]='B'
//used key like an index
>>> print dict[1]
A
>>>d{}
>>>d["A"]=1
>>>d["B"]=2
>>>print d
['A': 1, 'B':2]
//if (      ):
//def function():
//space/tab   ...code....
//for loops
//for i in range(0,100):
//    print "string"
////remember to tab after conditional
//for in list 
//    print i;
//python3 differences
//print statements need paranthesis ("  text  ")
//python3 is print "text "
//division in python 3 is floating point
//whereas division in python2 does integer division
//from_future_import print_function     //needed to import print function from python3 to 2
//from_future_import division
//python code for option parser
//we can use this to parse inputs
//parsing the arguments whilee
//option parser
//python lib: optparse
//comm -123 
//      -u         //the 123 and u are options
