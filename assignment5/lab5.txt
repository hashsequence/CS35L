first I wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall15/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

then I cd into the 
coreutils-with-bug 

./configure
make 

make failed so  I downloaded the patch coreutils.diff

patch -p0 < coreutils.diff

these are the files that were patched:


patching file lib/utimens.c
patching file lib/utimens.h
patching file src/copy.c
patching file src/tee.c
patching file src/touch.c


./configure
I then tried make again


now I tried testing the error:


mkdir tmp
[classave@lnxsrv09 ~/cs35l/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/src]$ cd tmp
[classave@lnxsrv09 ~/cs35l/lab5/coreutils-with-bug/src/tmp]$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice

-rw-r--r-- 1 classave class 0 2016-10-25 23:38:18.676493000 +0000 now


As you can see in this example 
armistice is listed above now1 even though it is obviously older than now1

I now began the debugging proces by first using GDB
on ls, that didnt get me anywhere since I didnt know where to 
put the breakpoints so I first looked at ls.c file and checked for 
sort and cmp since it the listing was a problem of sorting and comparing
which file is listed first or not, I narrowed it down to the cmp_mtime
,cmp_atime options and I noticed that it all calls the timespec_cmp 
function, which I thought could be the error since there was an issue with
comparing the timestamps on the files (this was latered confirmed when 
the TA was talking about how to do the lab on octover 27th) ,

now I need to find out where time_cmp is located, so I figured that the
function definition was declared in a header file in the lib folder, 
I checked and it was correct, alternatively I could have used the find
function and just used grep on "timespec" to find the hearder file
I emacs timespec.h

I found the time_cmp function 
I saw that 
there was a subtraction of 

 int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
  return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;


since there might be an issue of overflow if we merely subtract the 
two terms , the correction is to used if else statements to return
since it only matters if the value is positive, negative, or zero 
I just changed it to a simple if else return statments of 1, 0 ,-1
if (diff > 0)
{
return 1;
}
else if(diff < 0)
{
 return -1
}
else (diff == 0)
{
return 0;
}

now I had to make a patch so I 
unzipped the original coreutils-with-bug and renamed the patched version
by adding -patched to the name

I ran the command diff -u coreutils-with-bug/lib/timepec.h coreutils-with-bug-patched/lib/timespec.h > lab5.diff
