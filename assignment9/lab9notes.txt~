ssh
1)authentication
2)authorization
3)data Integrity 
4)consistency

Tel Net
Teletype Network

the the teletype was not secure so did not satisfy the above properties
sh --> secure SHell

communicate in a secure manner happens in encrypted fashion

two types of encryption:
symmetric one key to encrypt and decrypt
 ex. shifting by one ascii value A <-> B
DES/AES

assymmetric
2 different key
public key anyone can encyrpt the message
private key, only user can decrypt

ssh uses assymetric key encryption

RSA
related public key 
N = p x q

ssh
1) Host validation 
when you log in the first time it will ask a question and if you say yes it 
will put the public key into your machine, save on the client]
can decrypt with public key
2) client validation
the client cant inform the server, so the server can encrypt the message
and send it back to the user because client have private key, user can 
decrypt it 

password based authentication 
-> is the private key of clent, secured using password, which will give access
to private key and will be decrypted

SSH agent
is a program that will handle access to the private key
so you dont need to type password everytime
handled by client

FOR the lab we are doinf host validation
and client validattion
